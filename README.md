# Pharm-Pro, the Pharmacy Management Project was done as my 12th Grade Project for fulfilling Academic Criteria for passing along with my friend Suchinton
# The code was done with all of the raw 12th grade knowledge I had of coding, and I am aware of how much better this can be
# It served as a good experience of working in a team to code with people. The amount of disagreements and compromises required were more than I could have imagined.
